                <p>
                    I am a tech affine Nerd who is enthusiatic in the field of Software-Engineering (esp. Data, AI, Networking and Gamedesign).
                    In several semesters at University and my leisure time I have created several projects.
                    I would describe myself as a fast learning generalist with a passion for remarkable architecture.

                    At first I intended to pursue my dreams with an academic education, but unfortunatly I had to stop my
                    University endeavours. But that didn't stop me from working on my own projects.
                    I already worked with collaborators and international communities to improve and hone my services.
                    This website is my newest project, will track my progress and tell others about my work.
                    Feel free to leave comments, feedback and questions!
                    Got some work that I might be suited for?
